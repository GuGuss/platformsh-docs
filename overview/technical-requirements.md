Technical Requirements
======================

The only technical requirements for developing on Platform are **Git** and **SSH**.

Git
---

Git is the version control system used by Platformsh. You will need to have it installed to be able to interact with your codebase on Platform.sh.

SSH
---

You will need a SSH public/private keypair in order to interact with Platform.sh. Your public key is upladed to your Platform.sh user account, and it then governs authentication for Git, SSH sessions (shell access), and other tools that connect to your Platform.sh project.

The Platform.sh CLI
-------------------

Platform.sh has a dedication Command Line Interface (CLI) tool called *platform*. The *platform* tool gives enables you to use and manage all of your Platform.sh projects from the command line.

Download *platform* from [Github](https://github.com/commerceguys/platform-cli). Installation instructions are included in the readme file.
