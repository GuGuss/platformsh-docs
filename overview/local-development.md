Local Development
=================

In addition to your environments on Platform.sh, you also have one
more - your local development environment. You connect your local
environment to to Platform.sh.

If you are a web developer, chances are you are already running a local
hosting environment on your workstation. You edit the code and configure
the database, your application engine obeys your commands and your web
server hands over the resources.

One big benefit is the ability to work offline - you donâ€™t need to be
connected to the Internet to get stuff done. You can work on the train
and push your changes to Platform.sh later.

When you are online, you can download an environment to your
workstation, do your work and, when ready, upload to Platform.sh.
