connect to the Git community at [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com).

The Platform `master` branch is used for the live/production environment
in your project. Any other environment in the interface with have an
equivalent branch in Git.

Git commits and commit messages can be found in the activity feed of
platform_ui for the environment of each branch.

Before getting started with Platform, you'll want to make sure Git is
